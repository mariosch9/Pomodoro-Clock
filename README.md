# Pomodoro-Clock
This is a FED website project where I have created a podomoro clock time. The user can select the session and break lenght. The user can then start the timer. Once the time ends
for either cycle a beep will be hurt, meaning a new cycle has started. 

Further information:

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.
